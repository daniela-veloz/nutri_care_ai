    "This notebook implements a comprehensive RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system for processing nutritional disorder documents. The pipeline consists of several key stages:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Document Parsing & Extraction**\n",
    "- Uses LlamaParse to extract content from PDF documents in the docs/ folder\n",
    "- Specifically extracts both text content and structured tables from nutritional disorder documents\n",
    "- Handles table extraction with proper row/column structure preservation\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Semantic Chunking & Storage**\n",
    "- Implements semantic text splitting using LangChain's SemanticChunker with 80th percentile threshold\n",
    "- Creates 402 semantic chunks from the document corpus\n",
    "- Stores chunks in ChromaDB vectorstore with OpenAI embeddings (text-embedding-ada-002)\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Hypothetical Question Generation**\n",
    "- Generates 3 hypothetical questions for each semantic text chunk using GPT-4o-mini\n",
    "- Generates 3 hypothetical questions for each extracted table\n",
    "- Uses retry logic with exponential backoff to handle API rate limits\n",
    "- Filters out empty tables and low-quality content\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Advanced Retrieval Methods**\n",
    "- Implements structured retrieval using SelfQueryRetriever for intelligent metadata filtering\n",
    "- Supports querying by category, disorder type, page number, and content type (text/table)\n",
    "- Stores both original content and generated questions in separate vectorstore collections\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. Multi-Modal Search Capabilities**\n",
    "- Enables searching across both textual content and tabular data\n",
    "- Supports queries about specific nutritional requirements, disorders, and treatments\n",
    "- Provides contextual compression and cross-encoder reranking for improved relevance\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook demonstrates a LLM approach to medical document processing, combining structured data extraction with modern RAG techniques for enhanced question-answering capabilities."

Except for chromium, each of these is incorporated into enzymes or hormones required in\\nmetabolism. Except for deficiencies of iron and zinc, micromineral deficiencies are uncommon in\\ndeveloped countries (see Ch. 5).\\n\\nOther minerals (eg, aluminum, arsenic, boron, cobalt, fluoride, nickel, silicon, vanadium) have not been\\nproved essential for people. Fluoride, although not essential, helps prevent tooth decay by forming a\\ncompound with Ca (CaF2), which stabilizes the mineral matrix in teeth.\\n\\nAll trace minerals are toxic at high levels, and some (arsenic, nickel, and chromium) may cause cancer.\\n\\nOther Dietary Substances\\n\\nThe daily human diet typically contains as many as 100,000 chemicals (eg, coffee contains 1000). Of\\nthese, only 300 are nutrients, only some of which are essential. However, many nonnutrients in foods are\\nuseful. For example, food additives (eg, preservatives, emulsifiers, antioxidants, stabilizers) improve the\\nproduction and stability of foods. Trace components (eg, spices, flavors, odors, colors, phytochemicals,\\nmany other natural products) improve appearance and taste.\\n\\nFiber: Fiber occurs in various forms (eg, cellulose, hemicellulose, pectin, gums). It increases GI motility,\\nprevents constipation, and helps control diverticular disease. Fiber is thought to accelerate the elimination\\nof cancer-causing substances produced by bacteria in the large intestine. Epidemiologic evidence\\nsuggests an association between colon cancer and low fiber intake and a beneficial effect of fiber in\\npatients with functional bowel disorders, Crohn's disease, obesity, and hemorrhoids. Soluble fiber\\n(present in fruits, vegetables, oats, barley, and legumes) reduces the postprandial increase in blood\\nglucose and insulin and can reduce cholesterol levels.\\n\\nThe typical Western diet is low in fiber (about 12 g/day) because of a high intake of highly refined wheat\\nflour and a low intake of fruits and vegetables. Increasing fiber intake to about 30 g/day by consuming\\nmore vegetables, fruits, and high-fiber cereals and grains is generally recommended. However, very high\\nfiber intake may reduce absorption of certain minerals.\\n\\nNutritional Requirements\\n\\nGood nutrition aims to achieve and maintain a desirable body composition and high potential for physical\\nand mental work. Balancing energy intake with energy expenditure is necessary for a desirable body\\nweight. Energy expenditure depends on age, sex, weight (see Table 1-4), and metabolic and physical\\nactivity. If energy intake exceeds expenditure, weight is gained. Taking in about 100 calories/day more\\nthan needed results in a weight gain of about 4 to 5 kg in a year.

Nutrition: General Considerations\\nEvaluating general nutritional status includes history, physical examination, and sometimes tests. If\\nundernutrition is suspected, laboratory tests (eg, albumin levels) and skin tests for delayed\\nhypersensitivity may be done (see p.\\n13). Body composition analysis (eg, skinfold measurements, bioelectrical impedance analysis) is used to\\nestimate percentage of body fat and to evaluate obesity (see p. 58).\\n\\nHistory includes questions about dietary intake, weight change, and risk factors for nutritional deficiencies\\nand a focused review of systems (see\\nTable 2-1 on p. 11). A dietitian can obtain a more detailed dietary history. It usually includes a list of foods\\neaten within the previous 24 h and a food questionnaire. A food diary may be used to record all foods\\neaten. The weighed ad libitum diet, in which the patient weighs and writes down all foods consumed, is\\nthe most accurate record.\\n\\nA complete physical examination, including measurement of height and weight and distribution of body\\nfat, should be done. Body mass index (BMI)\\u2014weight(kg)/height(m)2, which adjusts weight for height (see\\nTable 6-2 on p. 59), is more accurate than height and weight tables. There are standards for growth and\\nweight gain in infants, children, and adolescents (see p. 2756).\\n\\nDistribution of body fat is important. Disproportionate truncal obesity (ie, waist/hip ratio > 0.8) is\\nassociated with cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disorders, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus more\\noften than fat located elsewhere. Measuring waist circumference in patients with a BMI of < 35 helps\\ndetermine whether they have truncal obesity and helps predict risk of diabetes, hypertension,\\nhypercholesterolemia, and cardiovascular disorders. Risk is increased if waist circumference is > 102 cm\\n(> 40 in) in men or > 88 cm (> 35 in) in women.\\n\\nNutrient-Drug Interactions\\n\\nNutrition can affect the body's response to drugs; conversely, drugs can affect the body's nutrition.\\n\\nFoods can enhance, delay, or decrease drug absorption. Foods impair absorption of many antibiotics.\\nThey can alter metabolism of drugs; eg, high-protein diets can accelerate metabolism of certain drugs by\\nstimulating cytochrome P-450. Eating grapefruit can inhibit cytochrome P-450 34A, slowing metabolism of\\nsome drugs (eg, amiodarone, carbamazepine, cyclosporine, certain Ca channel blockers). Diets that alter\\nthe bacterial flora may markedly affect the overall metabolism of certain drugs. Some foods affect the\\nbody's response to drugs. For example, tyramine, a component of cheese and a potent vasoconstrictor,\\ncan cause hypertensive crisis in some patients who take monoamine oxidase inhibitors and eat cheese.\\n\\nNutritional deficiencies can affect drug absorption and metabolism. Severe energy and protein\\ndeficiencies reduce enzyme tissue concentrations and may impair the response to drugs by reducing\\nabsorption or protein binding and causing liver dysfunction. Changes in the GI tract can impair absorption\\nand affect the response to a drug. Deficiency of Ca, Mg, or zinc may impair drug metabolism. Vitamin C\\ndeficiency decreases activity of drug-metabolizing enzymes, especially in the elderly.\\n\\nMany drugs affect appetite, food absorption, and tissue metabolism (see\\nTable 1-6). Some drugs (eg, metoclopramide) increase GI motility, decreasing food absorption. Other\\ndrugs (eg, opioids, anticholinergics) decrease GI motility. Some drugs are better tolerated if taken with\\nfood.\\n\\nCertain drugs affect mineral metabolism. For example, diuretics, especially thiazides, and corticosteroids\\ncan deplete body K, increasing susceptibility to digoxin-induced cardiac arrhythmias. Repeated use of\\nlaxatives may deplete K. Cortisol, desoxycorticosterone, and aldosterone cause marked Na and water\\nretention, at least temporarily; retention is much less with prednisone, prednisolone, and some other\\ncorticosteroid analogs. Sulfonylureas and lithium can impair the uptake or release of iodine by the thyroid.\\nOral contraceptives can lower blood zinc levels and increase copper levels.

Only amounts of additives shown to be safe by laboratory tests are permitted in commercially prepared foods.\\n\\nWeighing the benefits of additives (eg, reduced waste, increased variety of available foods, protection against food-borne illness) against the risks is often complex. For example, nitrite, which is used in cured meats, inhibits the growth of *Clostridium botulinum* and improves flavor. However, nitrite converts to nitrosamines, which are carcinogens in animals. On the other hand, the amount of nitrite added to cured meat is small compared with the amount from naturally occurring food nitrates converted to nitrite by the salivary glands.

It may result from inadequate intake, malabsorption, or use of various drugs.\\nDeficiency causes megaloblastic anemia (indistinguishable from that due to vitamin B12 deficiency).\\nMaternal deficiency increases the risk of neural tube birth defects. Diagnosis requires laboratory testing\\nto confirm. Measurement of neutrophil hypersegmentation is sensitive and readily available. Treatment\\nwith oral folate is usually successful.\\n\\nEtiology and Pathophysiology\\n\\nThe most common causes are inadequate intake (usually in patients with undernutrition or alcoholism),\\nincreased demand (eg, due to pregnancy or breastfeeding), and impaired absorption (eg, in tropical\\nsprue, due to certain drugs). Deficiency can also result from inadequate bioavailability and increased\\nexcretion (see\\nTable 4-4).\\n\\nProlonged cooking destroys folate, predisposing to inadequate intake. Intake is sometimes barely\\nadequate (eg, in alcoholics). Liver stores provide only a several-month supply.\\n\\nAlcohol interferes with folate absorption, metabolism, renal excretion, and enterohepatic reabsorption, as\\nwell as intake. 5-Fluorouracil, metformin, methotrexate, phenobarbital, phenytoin, sulfasalazine,\\ntriamterene, and trimethoprim impair folate metabolism.\\n\\nIn the US, many dietary staples (eg, cereals, grain products) are routinely enriched with folate, tending to\\nreduce risk of deficiency.\\n\\n[Table 4-3.

If serum\\nfolate is < 3 \\u03bcg/L or ng/mL (< 7 nmol/L), deficiency is likely. Serum folate reflects folate status unless\\nintake has recently increased or decreased. If intake has changed, erythrocyte (RBC) folate level better\\nreflects tissue stores. A level of < 140 \\u03bcg/L or ng/mL (< 305 nmol/L) indicates inadequate status.

Folate supplements do not protect against coronary artery disease or stroke (by lowering homocysteine levels); their role in reducing the risk of various cancers is unclear. The upper limit for folate intake is 1000 \\u03bcg; higher doses (up to 5 mg) are recommended for women who have had a baby with a neural tube defect. Folate is essentially nontoxic.\\n\\n# Folate Deficiency\\n\\nFolate deficiency is common. It may result from inadequate intake, malabsorption, or use of various drugs. Deficiency causes megaloblastic anemia (indistinguishable from that due to vitamin B12 deficiency). Maternal deficiency increases the risk of neural tube birth defects. Diagnosis requires laboratory testing to confirm. Measurement of neutrophil hypersegmentation is sensitive and readily available. Treatment with oral folate is usually successful.\\n\\n# Etiology and Pathophysiology\\n\\nThe most common causes are inadequate intake (usually in patients with undernutrition or alcoholism), increased demand (eg, due to pregnancy or breastfeeding), and impaired absorption (eg, in tropical sprue, due to certain drugs). Deficiency can also result from inadequate bioavailability and increased excretion (see Table 4-4).\\n\\nProlonged cooking destroys folate, predisposing to inadequate intake. Intake is sometimes barely adequate (eg, in alcoholics). Liver stores provide only a several-month supply.\\n\\nAlcohol interferes with folate absorption, metabolism, renal excretion, and enterohepatic reabsorption, as well as intake. 5-Fluorouracil, metformin, methotrexate, phenobarbital, phenytoin, sulfasalazine, triamterene, and trimethoprim impair folate metabolism.\\n\\nIn the US, many dietary staples (eg, cereals, grain products) are routinely enriched with folate, tending to reduce risk of deficiency.\\n\\n# Symptoms and Signs\\n\\nFolate deficiency may cause glossitis, diarrhea, depression, and confusion. Anemia may develop insidiously and, because of compensatory mechanisms, be more severe than symptoms suggest.\\n\\nFolate deficiency during pregnancy increases the risk of fetal neural tube defects and perhaps other brain defects (see p. 2992).\\n\\n# Diagnosis\\n\\n- CBC and serum vitamin B12 and folate levels\\n\\nCBC may indicate megaloblastic anemia indistinguishable from that of vitamin B12 deficiency. If serum folate is &#x3C; 3 \\u03bcg/L or ng/mL (&#x3C; 7 nmol/L), deficiency is likely. Serum folate reflects folate status unless intake has recently increased or decreased. If intake has changed, erythrocyte (RBC) folate level better reflects tissue stores. A level of &#x3C; 140 \\u03bcg/L or ng/mL (&#x3C; 305 nmol/L) indicates inadequate status. Also, an increase in the homocysteine level suggests tissue folate deficiency (but the level is also affected by\\n\\n\",\n",

A normal methylmalonic acid\\n(MMA) level may differentiate folate deficiency from vitamin B12 deficiency because MMA levels rise in\\nvitamin B12 deficiency but not in folate deficiency.\\n\\nTreatment\\n\\n\\u2022 Supplemental oral folate\\n\\nFolate 400 to 1000 \\u03bcg po once/day replenishes tissues and is usually successful even if deficiency has\\nresulted from malabsorption. The normal requirement is 400 \\u03bcg/day.\\n\\n[Table 4-4. Causes of Folate Deficiency]\\n\\n(CAUTION: In patients with megaloblastic anemia, vitamin B12 deficiency must be ruled out before\\ntreating with folate. If vitamin B12 deficiency is present, folate supplementation can alleviate the\\nanemia but does not reverse and may even worsen neurologic deficits.) For pregnant women, the\\nrecommended daily allowance (RDA) is 600 \\u03bcg/day. For women who have had a fetus or infant with a\\nneural tube defect, the recommended dose is 1000 to 5000 \\u03bcg/day.\\n\\nNiacin\\n\\nNiacin (nicotinic acid, nicotinamide) derivatives include nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) and\\nnicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP), which are coenzymes in oxidation-reduction\\nreactions. They are vital in cell metabolism. Because dietary tryptophan can be metabolized to niacin,\\nfoods rich in tryptophan (eg, dairy products) can compensate for inadequate dietary niacin.\\n\\nNiacin Deficiency\\n\\nDietary niacin deficiency (causing pellagra) is uncommon in developed countries. Clinical\\nmanifestations include the \\\"three Ds\\\": localized pigmented rash (dermatitis); gastroenteritis\\n(diarrhea); and widespread neurologic deficits, including cognitive decline (dementia).\\nDiagnosis is usually clinical, and dietary supplementation (oral or, if needed, IM) is usually\\nsuccessful.\\n\\nEtiology\\n\\nPrimary deficiency results from extremely inadequate intake of both niacin and tryptophan, which usually\\noccurs in areas where maize (Indian corn) constitutes a substantial part of the diet. Bound niacin, found in\\nmaize, is not assimilated in the GI tract unless it has been previously treated with alkali, as when tortillas\\nare prepared. Corn protein is also deficient in tryptophan. The high incidence of pellagra in India among\\npeople who eat millet with a high leucine content has led to the hypothesis that amino acid imbalance may\\ncontribute to deficiency. Deficiencies of protein and many B vitamins commonly accompany primary niacin\\ndeficiency.\\n\\nSecondary deficiency may be due to diarrhea, cirrhosis, or alcoholism. Pellagra also may occur in\\ncarcinoid syndrome (tryptophan is diverted to form 5-hydroxytryptophan and serotonin) and in Hartnup\\ndisease (absorption of tryptophan by the intestine and kidneys is defective).\\n\\nSymptoms and Signs\\n\\nPellagra is characterized by skin, mucous membrane, CNS, and GI symptoms.

Causes of Folate Deficiency]\\n\\n(CAUTION: In patients with megaloblastic anemia, vitamin B12 deficiency must be ruled out before treating with folate. If vitamin B12 deficiency is present, folate supplementation can alleviate the anemia but does not reverse and may even worsen neurologic deficits.) For pregnant women, the recommended daily allowance (RDA) is 600 \\u03bcg/day. For women who have had a fetus or infant with a neural tube defect, the recommended dose is 1000 to 5000 \\u03bcg/day.\\n\\n# Niacin\\n\\nNiacin (nicotinic acid, nicotinamide) derivatives include nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP), which are coenzymes in oxidation-reduction reactions. They are vital in cell metabolism. Because dietary tryptophan can be metabolized to niacin, foods rich in tryptophan (eg, dairy products) can compensate for inadequate dietary niacin.\\n\\n# Niacin Deficiency\\n\\nDietary niacin deficiency (causing pellagra) is uncommon in developed countries. Clinical manifestations include the \\\"three Ds\\\": localized pigmented rash (dermatitis); gastroenteritis (diarrhea); and widespread neurologic deficits, including cognitive decline (dementia). Diagnosis is usually clinical, and dietary supplementation (oral or, if needed, IM) is usually successful.\\n\\n# Etiology\\n\\nPrimary deficiency results from extremely inadequate intake of both niacin and tryptophan, which usually occurs in areas where maize (Indian corn) constitutes a substantial part of the diet. Bound niacin, found in maize, is not assimilated in the GI tract unless it has been previously treated with alkali, as when tortillas are prepared. Corn protein is also deficient in tryptophan. The high incidence of pellagra in India among people who eat millet with a high leucine content has led to the hypothesis that amino acid imbalance may contribute to deficiency. Deficiencies of protein and many B vitamins commonly accompany primary niacin deficiency.\\n\\nSecondary deficiency may be due to diarrhea, cirrhosis, or alcoholism. Pellagra also may occur in carcinoid syndrome (tryptophan is diverted to form 5-hydroxytryptophan and serotonin) and in Hartnup disease (absorption of tryptophan by the intestine and kidneys is defective).\\n\\n# Symptoms and Signs\\n\\nPellagra is characterized by skin, mucous membrane, CNS, and GI symptoms. Advanced pellagra can cause a symmetric photosensitive rash, stomatitis, glossitis, diarrhea, and mental aberrations. Symptoms may appear alone or in combination.\\n\\nSkin symptoms include several types of lesions, which are usually bilaterally symmetric. The distribution of lesions\\u2014at pressure points or sun-exposed skin\\u2014is more pathognomonic than the form of the lesions. Lesions can develop in a glovelike distribution on the hands (pellagrous glove) or in a boot-shaped.\\n\\n\",\n",

      "                    \"md\": \"Niacin (nicotinic acid) in large amounts is sometimes used to lower low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and triglyceride levels and to increase high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels. Symptoms may include flushing and, rarely, hepatotoxicity.\\n\\nImmediate- and sustained-release preparations of niacin (but not nicotinamide) may improve lipid levels. Flushing, which is prostaglandin-mediated, is more common with immediate-release preparations. It may be more intense after alcohol ingestion, aerobic activity, sun exposure, and consumption of spicy foods. Flushing is minimized if niacin is taken after meals or if aspirin (325 mg) is taken 30 to 45 min before niacin. The chance of severe flushing can be reduced by starting immediate-release niacin at a low dose (eg, 50 mg tid) and increasing it very slowly. At intermediate doses (1000 mg/day), triglyceride levels decrease 15 to 20%, and HDL cholesterol levels increase 15 to 30%. Reductions in LDL cholesterol are modest (&#x3C; 10%). Higher doses of niacin (3000 mg/day) reduce LDL cholesterol 15 to 20% but may cause jaundice, abdominal discomfort, blurred vision, worsening of hyperglycemia, and precipitation of preexisting gout.

Both\\ntypes usually cause headache and increased intracranial pressure. Acute toxicity also causes\\nnausea and vomiting. Chronic toxicity also causes changes in skin, hair, and nails; abnormal\\nliver test results; and, in a fetus, birth defects. Diagnosis is usually clinical. Unless birth defects\\nare present, adjusting the dose almost always leads to complete recovery.\\n\\nAcute vitamin A toxicity in children may result from taking large doses (> 100,000 RAE [> 300,000 IU]),\\nusually accidentally. In adults, acute toxicity has occurred when arctic explorers ingested polar bear or\\nseal livers, which contain several million units of vitamin A.\\n\\nChronic toxicity in older children and adults usually develops after doses of > 30,000 RAE (> 100,000\\nIU)/day have been taken for months. Megavitamin therapy is a possible cause, as are massive daily\\ndoses (50,000 to 120,000 RAE [150,000 to 350,000 IU]) of vitamin A or its metabolites, which are\\nsometimes given for nodular acne or other skin disorders. Adults who consume > 1500 RAE (> 4500\\nIU)/day of vitamin A may develop osteoporosis. Infants who are given excessive doses (6,000 to 20,000\\nRAE [18,000 to 60,000 IU]/day) of water-miscible vitamin A may develop toxicity within a few weeks. Birth\\ndefects occur in children of women receiving isotretinoin (which is related to vitamin A) for acne treatment\\nduring pregnancy.\\n\\nAlthough carotene is converted to vitamin A in the body, excessive ingestion of carotene causes\\ncarotenemia, not vitamin A toxicity. Carotenemia is usually asymptomatic but may lead to carotenodermia,\\nin which the skin becomes yellow. When taken as a supplement, \\u03b2-carotene has been associated with\\nincreased cancer risk; risk does not seem to increase when carotenoids are consumed in fruits and\\nvegetables.\\n\\nSymptoms and Signs\\n\\nAlthough symptoms may vary, headache and rash usually develop during acute or chronic toxicity. Acute\\ntoxicity causes increased intracranial pressure. Drowsiness, irritability, abdominal pain, nausea, and\\nvomiting are common. Sometimes the skin subsequently peels.\\n\\nEarly symptoms of chronic toxicity are sparsely distributed, coarse hair; alopecia of the eyebrows; dry,\\nrough skin; dry eyes; and cracked lips. Later, severe headache, pseudotumor cerebri, and generalized\\nweakness develop. Cortical hyperostosis of bone and arthralgia may occur, especially in children.\\nFractures may occur easily, especially in the elderly. In children, toxicity can cause pruritus, anorexia, and\\nfailure to thrive.

Causes of Vitamin B12 Deficiency]\\n\\nliver stores (which are normally extensive) are limited and their rapid growth rate results in high demand.\\n\\nVitamin B12 deficiency usually results from inadequate absorption (see Table 4-5 and p. 153), which, in\\nthe elderly, most commonly results from decreased acid secretion. In such cases, crystalline vitamin B12\\n(such as that available in vitamin supplements) can be absorbed, but food-bound vitamin B12 is not\\nliberated and absorbed normally. Inadequate absorption may occur in blind loop syndrome (with\\novergrowth of bacteria) or fish tapeworm infestation; in these cases, bacteria or parasites use ingested\\nvitamin B12 so that less is available for absorption. Vitamin B12 absorption may be inadequate if ileal\\nabsorptive sites are destroyed by inflammatory bowel disease or are surgically removed. Less common\\ncauses of inadequate vitamin B12 absorption include chronic pancreatitis, gastric surgery, malabsorption\\nsyndromes, AIDS, use of certain drugs (eg, antacids, metformin), repeated exposure to nitrous oxide, and\\na genetic disorder causing malabsorption in the ileum (Imerslund-Graesbeck syndrome).\\n\\nPernicious anemia is often used synonymously with vitamin B12 deficiency. However, pernicious\\nanemia specifically refers to anemia resulting from vitamin B12 deficiency caused by an autoimmune\\nmetaplastic atrophic gastritis with loss of intrinsic factor (see p. 133). Patients with classic pernicious\\nanemia, most commonly younger adults, are at increased risk of stomach and other GI cancers.\\n\\nSubacute combined degeneration refers to degenerative changes in the nervous system due to\\nvitamin B12 deficiency; they affect mostly brain and spinal cord white matter. Demyelinating or axonal\\nperipheral neuropathies can occur.\\n\\nSymptoms and Signs\\n\\nAnemia usually develops insidiously. It is often more severe than its symptoms indicate because its slow\\nevolution allows physiologic adaptation. Occasionally, splenomegaly and hepatomegaly occur. Various GI\\nsymptoms, including weight loss and poorly localized abdominal pain, may occur. Glossitis, usually\\ndescribed as burning of the tongue, is uncommon.\\n\\nNeurologic symptoms develop independently from and often without hematologic abnormalities. In early\\nstages, decreased position and vibratory sensation in the extremities is accompanied by mild to moderate\\nweakness and hyporeflexia. In later stages, spasticity, extensor plantar responses, greater loss of position\\nand vibratory sensation in the lower extremities, and ataxia emerge. These deficits may develop in a\\nstocking-glove distribution. Tactile, pain, and temperature sensations are usually spared but may be\\ndifficult to assess in the elderly.\\n\\nSome patients are also irritable and mildly depressed. Paranoia (megaloblastic madness), delirium,\\nconfusion, spastic ataxia, and, at times, postural hypotension may occur in advanced cases. The\\nconfusion may be difficult to differentiate from age-related dementias, such as Alzheimer's disease.\\n\\nDiagnosis\\n\\n\\u2022 CBC and vitamin B12 and folate levels\\n\\n\\u2022 Sometimes methylmalonic acid levels or Schilling test\\n\\n                                                                                                           87\",\n",

Vitamin Deficiency, Dependency & Toxicity\\nDiagnosis is based on CBC and vitamin B12 and folate levels. It is important to remember that severe\\nneurologic disease may occur without anemia or macrocytosis.\\n\\nCBC detects megaloblastic anemia. Tissue deficiency and macrocytic indexes may precede the\\ndevelopment of anemia. A vitamin B12 level < 200 pg/mL (< 145 pmol/L) indicates vitamin B12 deficiency.\\nThe folate level is measured because vitamin B12 deficiency must be differentiated from folate deficiency\\nas a cause of megaloblastic anemia; folate supplementation can mask vitamin B12 deficiency and may\\nalleviate megaloblastic anemia but allow the neurologic deficits to progress or even accelerate.\\n\\nWhen clinical judgment suggests vitamin B12 deficiency but the vitamin B12 level is low-normal (200 to\\n350 pg/mL [145 to 260 pmol/L]) or hematologic indexes are normal, other tests can be done. Measuring\\nserum methylmalonic acid (MMA) levels may be useful. An elevated MMA level supports vitamin B12\\ndeficiency but may be due to renal failure. MMA levels can also be used to monitor the response to\\ntreatment. MMA levels remain normal in folate deficiency; homocysteine levels may be elevated with\\neither vitamin B12 or folate deficiency. Less commonly, holotranscobalamin II (transcobalamin II-B12\\ncomplex) content is measured; when holotranscobalamin II is < 40 pg/mL (< 30 pmol/L), vitamin B12 is\\ndeficient.\\n\\nAfter deficiency is diagnosed, additional tests may be indicated for younger adults but usually not for the\\nelderly. Unless dietary vitamin B12 is obviously inadequate, measurement of serum gastrin levels or\\nautoantibodies to intrinsic factor may be done; sensitivity and specificity of these tests may be poor.\\n\\nSchilling test: The Schilling test is useful only if diagnosing intrinsic factor deficiency is important, as in\\nclassic pernicious anemia. This test is not necessary for most elderly patients. The Schilling test\\nmeasures absorption of free radiolabeled vitamin B12. Radiolabeled vitamin B12 is given orally, followed\\nin 1 to 6 h by 1000 \\u03bcg (1 mg) of parenteral vitamin B12, which reduces uptake of radiolabeled vitamin\\nB12 by the liver. Absorbed radiolabeled vitamin B12 is excreted in urine, which is collected for 24 h. The\\namount excreted is measured, and the percentage of total radiolabeled vitamin B12 is determined. If\\nabsorption is normal, \\u2265 9% of the dose given appears in the urine. Reduced urinary excretion (< 5% if\\nkidney function is normal) indicates inadequate vitamin B12 absorption. Improved absorption with the\\nsubsequent addition of intrinsic factor to radiolabeled vitamin B12 confirms the diagnosis of pernicious\\nanemia. The test is often difficult to do or interpret because of incomplete urine collection or renal\\ninsufficiency. In addition, because the Schilling test does not measure absorption of protein-bound vitamin\\nB12, the test does not detect defective liberation of vitamin B12 from foods, which is common among the\\nelderly. The Schilling test repletes vitamin B12 and can mask deficiency, so it should be done only after all\\nother diagnostic tests and therapeutic trials.\\n\\nIf malabsorption is identified, the Schilling test can be repeated after a 2-wk trial of an oral antibiotic.

If the MMA level\\n(sometimes used to monitor treatment) does not decrease, patients may not be taking vitamin B12.

Vitamin Deficiency, Dependency & Toxicity\\n\\n\\u2022 Usually, skin or gingival findings and risk factors\\n\\nDiagnosis is usually made clinically in a patient who has skin or gingival signs and is at risk of vitamin C\\ndeficiency. Laboratory confirmation may be available. Anemia is common. Bleeding, coagulation, and PT\\nare normal.\\n\\nSkeletal x-rays can help diagnose childhood (but not adult) scurvy.

Levels of < 0.6 mg/dL (< 34 \\u03bcmol/L) are considered marginal; levels of < 0.2 mg/dL (< 11 \\u03bcmol/L)\\nindicate vitamin C deficiency. Measurement of ascorbic acid levels in the WBC-platelet layer of\\ncentrifuged blood is not widely available or standardized.\\n\\nIn adults, scurvy must be differentiated from arthritis, hemorrhagic disorders, gingivitis, and protein-energy\\nundernutrition. Hyperkeratotic hair follicles with surrounding hyperemia or hemorrhage are almost\\npathognomonic. Bleeding gums, conjunctival hemorrhages, most petechiae, and ecchymoses are\\nnonspecific.\\n\\nTreatment\\n\\n\\u2022 Nutritious diet with supplemental ascorbic acid\\n\\nFor scurvy in adults, ascorbic acid 100 to 500 mg po tid is given for 1 to 2 wk, until signs disappear, and\\nfollowed by a nutritious diet supplying 1 to 2 times the daily recommended intake. In scurvy, therapeutic\\ndoses of ascorbic acid restore the functions of vitamin C in a few days. The symptoms and signs usually\\ndisappear over 1 to 2 wk. Chronic gingivitis with extensive subcutaneous hemorrhage persists longer.\\n\\nPrevention\\n\\nVitamin C 75 mg po once/day for women and 90 mg po once/day for men prevents deficiency. Smokers\\nshould consume an additional 35 mg/day. Five servings of most fruits and vegetables (recommended\\ndaily) provide > 200 mg of vitamin C.\\n\\nVitamin C Toxicity\\n\\nThe upper limit for vitamin C intake is 2000 mg/day. Up to 10 g/day of vitamin C are sometimes taken for\\nunproven health benefits, such as preventing or shortening the duration of viral infections or slowing or\\nreversing the progression of cancer or atherosclerosis. Such doses may acidify the urine, cause nausea\\nand diarrhea, interfere with the healthy antioxidant-prooxidant balance in the body, and, in patients with\\nthalassemia or hemochromatosis, promote iron overload. Intake below the upper limit does not have toxic\\neffects in healthy adults.\\n\\nVitamin D\\n\\nVitamin D has 2 main forms: D2 (ergocalciferol) and D3 (cholecalciferol); the latter is the naturally\\noccurring form and the form used for low-dose supplementation. Vitamin D3 is synthesized in skin by\\nexposure to direct sunlight (ultraviolet B radiation) and obtained in the diet chiefly in fish liver oils and salt\\nwater fish. In some developed countries, milk and other foods are fortified with vitamin D. Human breast\\nmilk is low in vitamin D, containing an average of only 10% of the amount in fortified cow's milk.\\nRequirements for vitamin D increase with age because skin synthesis declines.

Patients with kidney disorders often need 1,25(OH)2D supplementation.\\n\\nType I hereditary vitamin D-dependent rickets responds to 1,25(OH)2D 1 to 2 \\u03bcg po once/day. Some patients with type II hereditary vitamin D-dependent rickets respond to very high doses (eg, 10 to 24 \\u03bcg/day) of 1,25(OH)2D; others require long-term infusions of Ca.\",\n",

Rarely, these rings occur in other liver\\ndisorders (eg, biliary atresia, primary biliary cirrhosis), but ceruloplasmin levels should be unaffected.\\n\\nCeruloplasmin: Serum ceruloplasmin (normally 20 to 35 mg/dL) is usually low in Wilson's disease but\\ncan be normal. It can also be low in heterozygous carriers and those with other liver disorders (eg, viral\\nhepatitis, drug- or alcohol-induced liver disease). A low ceruloplasmin level in a patient with a Kayser-\\nFleischer ring is diagnostic. Also, a level of < 5 mg/dL is highly suggestive regardless of clinical findings.\\n\\nSerum copper: Despite the copper accumulation in the body, serum copper levels are decreased\\nbecause of the decreased ceruloplasmin levels.\\n\\nUrinary copper excretion: In Wilson's disease, 24-h urinary copper excretion (normally, \\u2264 30 \\u03bcg/day) is\\nusually > 100 \\u03bcg/day. If serum ceruloplasmin is low and urinary copper excretion is high, diagnosis is\\nclear.

However, false-negative results may occur because of a sampling error\\n(due to large variations in copper concentrations in the liver) or fulminant hepatitis (causing necrosis that\\nreleases large amounts of copper).\\n\\nScreening: Because early treatment is most effective, screening is indicated for anyone who has a\\nsibling, cousin, or parent with Wilson's disease.

Cross-reactivity may occur in people with penicillin allergy.\\nPatients > 5 yr are given oral doses of 62.5 mg q 6 h to 250 mg q 12 h (250 to 500 mg/day in 2 to 4\\ndoses) and slowly increased to a maximum of 250 mg q 6 h to 750 mg q 12 h (1000 to 1500 mg/day in 2\\nto 4 doses). Younger children are given 10 mg/kg bid or 6.7 mg/kg tid (20 mg/kg/d) po. Pyridoxine 25 mg\\npo once/day is given with penicillamine. Occasionally, use of penicillamine is associated with worsening\\nneurologic symptoms.\\n\\nTrientine hydrochloride is an alternative treatment to penicillamine. Doses are 375 to 750 mg po bid or\\n250 to 500 mg po tid (750 to 1500 mg/day).\\n\\nZinc acetate 50 mg po tid can prevent reaccumulation of copper in patients who cannot tolerate\\npenicillamine or trientine or who have neurologic symptoms that do not respond to the other drugs.\\n(CAUTION: Penicillamine or trientine must not be given with zinc because either drug can bind zinc,\\nforming a compound with no therapeutic effect.)\\n\\nPoor long-term adherence to drug therapy is common. After 1 to 5 yr of therapy, lower dose maintenance\\ndrug therapy can be considered. Regular follow-up care with an expert in liver disease is recommended.\\n\\nLiver transplantation may be lifesaving for patients who have Wilson's disease and fulminant hepatic\\nfailure or severe hepatic insufficiency refractory to drugs.\\n\\nFluorine\\n\\nMost of the body's fluorine (F) is contained in bones and teeth. Fluoride (the ionic form of fluorine) is\\nwidely distributed in nature. The main source of fluoride is fluoridated drinking water.\\n\\nDeficiency: Fluorine deficiency can lead to dental caries and possibly osteoporosis. Fluoridation of\\nwater that contains < 1 ppm (the ideal) reduces the incidence of dental caries. If a child's drinking water is\\nnot fluoridated, oral fluoride supplements can be prescribed.\\n\\nToxicity: Excess fluorine can accumulate in teeth and bones, causing fluorosis. Drinking water\\ncontaining > 10 ppm is a common cause. Permanent teeth that develop during high fluoride intake are\\nmost likely to be affected. Exposure must be much greater to affect deciduous teeth.\\n\\nThe earliest signs are chalky white, irregularly distributed patches on the surface of the enamel; these\\npatches become stained yellow or brown, producing a characteristic mottled appearance. Severe toxicity\\nweakens the enamel, pitting its surface. Bony changes, including osteosclerosis, exostoses of the spine,\\nand genu valgum, can develop but only in adults after prolonged high intake of fluoride.\\n\\nNo tests to diagnose toxicity are available.\\n\\nTreatment involves reducing fluoride intake; eg, in areas with high fluoride water levels, patients should\\nnot drink fluoridated water or take fluoride supplements.

In certain areas of China, where intake\\naverages 10 to 15 \\u03bcg/day, selenium deficiency predisposes patients to Keshan disease, an endemic viral\\ncardiomyopathy affecting primarily children and young women. This cardiomyopathy can be prevented\\nbut not cured by sodium selenite supplements of 50 \\u03bcg/day po. Patients receiving long-term TPN have\\ndeveloped selenium deficiency with muscle pain and tenderness that responded to a selenomethionine\\nsupplement.

Symptoms usually resolve after 12 to 24 h in a zinc-free environment.\\n\\n107\",\n",

Signs of PEU (eg, edema,\\nmuscle wasting, skin changes) should be sought. Examination should also focus on signs of conditions\\nthat could predispose to nutritional deficiencies, such as dental problems. Mental status should be\\nassessed, because depression and cognitive impairment can lead to weight loss. The widely used Subjective Global Assessment (SGA) uses information from the patient history (eg,\\nweight loss, change in intake, GI symptoms), physical examination findings (eg, loss of muscle and\\nsubcutaneous fat, edema, ascites), and the clinician's judgment of the patient's nutritional status. The\\nMini Nutritional Assessment (MNA) has been validated and is widely used, especially for elderly patients\\n(see \\nFig. 2-1\\n).
